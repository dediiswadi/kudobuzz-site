  <LegalPage title="Terms of Service">
    <Fragment slot="intro">
      <p>
        These Terms of Service govern your use of the Kudobuzz platform, applications, and related
        services. By creating an account or otherwise accessing Kudobuzz you agree to these terms and
        any policies referenced here, including our Privacy Policy.
      </p>
    </Fragment>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>1. Using Kudobuzz</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years old and have the legal authority to enter into contracts to
        use Kudobuzz. You are responsible for the activity that happens under your account and for
        keeping your password secure. You agree not to misuse the service, interfere with other
        customers, or attempt to access Kudobuzz using methods other than the interface provided.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>2. Customer Content</h2>
      <p>
        You retain ownership of the content you submit to Kudobuzz. By uploading or importing
        content you grant Kudobuzz a worldwide, non-exclusive licence to host, store, and display it
        for the purpose of delivering the service. You are responsible for ensuring you have the
        necessary rights to share any content and for complying with applicable laws and platform
        guidelines.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>3. Plans & Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Fees for paid plans are charged in advance on a recurring basis unless stated otherwise. By
        upgrading you authorise Kudobuzz and our payment processor to charge the applicable fees.
        Charges are non-refundable except where required by law. You may downgrade or cancel your
        plan at any time; changes will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>
        You agree not to use Kudobuzz to collect or distribute unlawful content, send unsolicited or
        deceptive communications, infringe intellectual property rights, or violate the privacy of
        your customers. We may suspend or terminate accounts that breach these obligations or pose a
        risk to the platform or other users.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>5. Service Availability</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to provide a reliable service but do not guarantee uninterrupted uptime. From time to
        time maintenance or updates may impact availability. Kudobuzz is provided on an “as is” basis
        without warranties of any kind, and our liability is limited to the amount paid for the
        service in the preceding 12 months.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>6. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You may terminate your account at any time via the Kudobuzz dashboard. We may terminate or
        suspend access if you violate these terms, fail to pay fees, or if providing the service is
        no longer commercially reasonable. Upon termination we will delete or return your content in
        accordance with our data retention commitments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>7. Changes To The Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may revise these terms to reflect changes to our services or legal requirements. If we
        make material changes we will notify you via email or the dashboard. Continued use of
        Kudobuzz after the revised terms take effect constitutes acceptance.
