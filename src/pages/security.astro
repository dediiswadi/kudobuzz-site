        Security is core to Kudobuzz. This page describes how we protect customer data and the
        controls you can expect when using our platform.

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>1. Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>
        Kudobuzz is hosted on leading cloud infrastructure with built-in redundancy, firewalls, and
        continuous monitoring. Production systems are segmented from corporate networks and access is
        restricted using least-privilege principles and multi-factor authentication.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>2. Data Protection</h2>
      <p>
        All traffic to and from Kudobuzz is encrypted using TLS 1.2+ and strong cipher suites. Data
        at rest is encrypted using AES-256. Backups are performed automatically and tested to ensure
        recoverability. We retain backups for a limited period to guard against accidental loss.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>3. Application Security</h2>
      <p>
        We follow secure development lifecycle practices, including peer code reviews, dependency
        management, and automated testing. Regular penetration tests and vulnerability scans are
        performed by trusted external specialists. Critical issues are triaged immediately and
        patched according to severity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>4. Compliance & Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Kudobuzz aligns with global privacy regulations, including GDPR and CCPA. Data processing
        agreements are available for customers who need additional assurances. We maintain detailed
        audit logs and employ data minimisation practices to collect only what is necessary.
